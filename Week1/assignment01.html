By: Labiba Alam


I chose five museums that I thought were unusual to test and improve their web-accessibility and search engine
optimization for this project. From researching these sites, I've learned
that screen readers often get overlooked when it comes to web design accessibility. I've also noticed that
sites that are close to a full SEO score often don't included a meta description which would bring their site's score to
100%.

I used Chrome Development tool lighthouse to diagnose the accessibility and SEO score of the following sites:

1) International Banana Museum, 
    http://www.internationalbananamuseum.com, Accessibility score (93), SEO score
(80) 

Ways to improve their scores: 

    They can add a 
        < meta name="viewport" > tag to optimize their website for mobile screens
    
    They could add a meta description which might be included in search results to concisely summarize page content.
    


2) Museum of Broken Relationships, https://brokenships.com, Accessibility score (67), SEO
score (82)


Ways to improve their scores:

    They can increase the contrast ratio between the background and foreground colors.
    Their image elements could have alternate text for screen readers.


3) International Crytozoology Museum, https://cryptozoologymuseum.com,
Accessibility score (85), SEO score (92) 

Ways to improve their scores:

    They can organize their heading elements in a sequentially-descending order to make it easier for screen
        readers.
    They can add a [lang] attribute so screen readers understand whether or not the page is in its default language.
    


4) Museum of Death, http://www.museumofdeath.net, Accessibility score (67), SEO score
(92)

Ways to improve their scores:

    They can add labels to their form elements to ensure that the form controls are announced properly by screen
        readers.
    They can enable zooming for people with visual impairments.

5) National Funeral Museum, https://www.nmfh.org>https://www.nmfh.org, Accessibility score (74), SEO score (73)


Ways to improve their scores:

    They can add descriptive link text which would help search engines understand their content.
    They can add crawlable links to ensure that the `href` attribute of anchor elements links to an appropriate
        destination, so more pages of the site can be discovered.
