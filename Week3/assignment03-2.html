        <h2>Jazz Funerals of New Orleans</h2>

        <p>The museum's new exhibit opens on November 12. This exhibition will focus on
            how
            a
            common way to bid farewell to a loved one originated with a jazz funeral or
            a
            funeral with music that is now a tradition unique to the city of New
            Orleans,
            especially among the African American community.

    After running lighthouse for the National Museum of Funeral History,
    I noticed a score of 74 for accessibility. After delving deeper
    into what was causing this issue,
    I noticed the following issues affected the overall score: <br> <br>

    - low color contrast <br>
    - nonsequential heading elements <br>
    - no [lang] attribute <br>
    - images without [alt] attributes <br>

    <br>
    The original accessibility score is 74 and the original SEO score is 73.
    I noticed the issues were nonsequential heading elements and the
    no [lang] attribute.
    After fixing the semantic style and adding alt attributes to the scores' images as well as
    adding sequential heading elements
    and also adding more descriptive text to some of the Museum's Read More/Learn
    More links, the accessibility score went up to 100, and SEO score went up to 80. The
    SEO score doesn't go up as high as the accessibility score because this is a markup
    of the site and therefore it won't get as much traffic as the original.
